abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for the visualization and clustering of crowd video contents by using multilin-ear principal component analysis (MPCA). In contrast to feature-point-based approach and frame-based dimension-ality reduction approach, the proposed method maps each short video segment to a point in MPCA subspace to take temporal information into account naturally through tenso-rial representations. Specifically, MPCA projects each short segment of a video to a low-dimensional tensor first. A few MPCA features are then selected according to the variance captured as the final representation. Thus, a video is visualized as a trajectory in MPCA subspace. The trajec-tory generated enables visual interpretation of video content in a compact space as well as visual clustering of video events. The proposed method is evaluated on the PETS 2009 datasets through comparison with three existing methods for video visualization. The MPCA visualization shows superior performance in clustering segments of the same event as well as identifying the transitions between events.},

abstract = {There has been increased interest in missing sensor data imputation, which is ubiquitous in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM) due to discontinuous sensing caused by sensor malfunction. To address this fundamental issue, this paper presents an incremental Bayesian tensor learning method for reconstruction of spatiotemporal missing data in SHM and forecasting of structural response. In particular, a spatiotemporal tensor is first constructed followed by Bayesian tensor factorization that extracts latent features for missing data imputation. To enable structural response forecasting based on incomplete sensing data, the tensor decomposition is further integrated with vector autoregression in an incremental learning scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on continuous field-sensing data (including strain and temperature records) of a concrete bridge, based on the assumption that strain time histories are highly correlated to temperature recordings. The results indicate that the proposed probabilistic tensor learning approach is accurate and robust even in the presence of large rates of random missing, structured missing and their combination. The effect of rank selection on the imputation and prediction performance is also investigated. The results show that a better estimation accuracy can be achieved with a higher rank for random missing whereas a lower rank for structured missing.},

abstract = {We study the problem of low-rank tensor factorization in the presence of missing data. We ask the following question: how many sampled entries do we need, to efficiently and exactly reconstruct a tensor with a low-rank orthogonal decomposition? We propose a novel alternating minimization based method which iteratively refines estimates of the singular vectors. We show that under certain standard assumptions, our method can recover a three-mode $n\times n\times n$ dimensional rank-$r$ tensor exactly from $O(n^{3/2} r^5 \log^4 n)$ randomly sampled entries. In the process of proving this result, we solve two challenging sub-problems for tensors with missing data. First, in the process of analyzing the initialization step, we prove a generalization of a celebrated result by Szemer\'edie et al. on the spectrum of random graphs. Next, we prove global convergence of alternating minimization with a good initialization. Simulations suggest that the dependence of the sample size on dimensionality $n$ is indeed tight.},

abstract = {A tensor is a multidimensional array. First-order tensors and second-order tensors can be viewed as vectors and matrices, respectively. Tensors of higher order, with the ability to include more information , appear more frequently nowadays in image and signal processing, data mining, biomedical engineering, and so on. With the recent work of Kilmer and Martin, familiar matrix-based fac-torizations in linear algebra can be extended in a straightforward way to third-order tensors based on their new tensor multiplication and concepts. Our method has an advantage over a popular tensor-based face recognition algorithm called TensorFaces, which is based on the higher-order SVD of an arrangement of the images in a database, in that it does not require a least squares solve for the coefficients. In this paper, we give a brief introduction to the new tensor framework and apply the induced tensor decompositions to the application of facial recognition. In the numerical results, we compare our new approaches with the traditional principal component analysis method based on matrix decomposition (also known as eigenfaces) and with TensorFaces. 1. Introduction. A tensor is a multidimensional array. A first-order tensor is a vector, a second-order tensor is a matrix, and a tensor of order 3 or higher is a higher-order tensor. In many cases, it is appropriate to store data in higher-order multidimensional arrays, rather than as a matricized equivalent form. Consider the example of storing photos of different individuals taken under different lighting conditions with different gestures and viewpoints. The use of a higher-order tensor would allow for storage of the images in a fifth-order tensor with modes of people, lighting conditions, gestures, viewpoints, and pixels [31]. In HITS link analysis [15], use of a third-order tensor allows the inclusion of term information to the traditional adjacency matrix of the links between hubs and authorities. In general, higher-order tensors arise in a wide variety of application areas, for example, in chemometrics [27], psychometrics [17], and image and signal processing [5, 18, 26, 23, 10, 25, 31, 30, 32]. As a result, a number of tensor decompositions, such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) [3, 9], Tucker [28], and higher-order SVD [19] and tensor-tensor decompositions [13], have been developed to facilitate the extension of linear algebra tools to this multilinear context.},

These results improve on prior work by Candes and Recht, Candes and Tao, and Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh. The reconstruction is accomplished by minimizing the nuclear norm, or sum of the singular values, of the hidden matrix subject to agreement with the provided entries. If the underlying matrix satisfies a certain incoherence condition, then the number of entries required is equal to a quadratic logarithmic factor times the number of parameters in the singular value decomposition. The proof of this assertion is short, self contained, and uses very elementary analysis. The novel techniques herein are based on recent work in quantum information theory.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose novel methods for completion (from limited samples) and de-noising of multilinear (tensor) data and as an application consider 3-D and 4- D (color) video data completion and de-noising. We exploit the recently proposed tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD)[11]. Based on t-SVD, the notion of multilinear rank and a related tensor nuclear norm was proposed in [11] to characterize informational and structural complexity of multilinear data. We first show that videos with linear camera motion can be represented more efficiently using t-SVD compared to the approaches based on vectorizing or flattening of the tensors. Since efficiency in representation implies efficiency in recovery, we outline a tensor nuclear norm penalized algorithm for video completion from missing entries. Application of the proposed algorithm for video recovery from missing entries is shown to yield a superior performance over existing methods. We also consider the problem of tensor robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for de-noising 3-D video data from sparse random corruptions. We show superior performance of our method compared to the matrix robust PCA adapted to this setting as proposed in [4].},

In an important sparse-vector approximation problem (compressed sensing) and the low-rank matrix recovery problem, using a convex relaxation technique proved to be a valuable solution strategy. Here, we will adapt these techniques to the tensor setting. We use the n-rank of a tensor as a sparsity measure and consider the low-n-rank tensor recovery problem, i.e. the problem of finding the tensor of the lowest n-rank that fulfills some linear constraints. We introduce a tractable convex relaxation of the n-rank and propose efficient algorithms to solve the low-n-rank tensor recovery problem numerically. The algorithms are based on the Douglas-Rachford splitting technique and its dual variant, the alternating direction method of multipliers. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Here we present integrative risk gene selector (iRIGS), a Bayesian framework that integrates multi-omics data and gene networks to infer risk genes in GWAS loci. By applying iRIGS to SCZ GWAS data, we predicted a set of high-confidence risk genes, most of which are not the nearest genes to the GWAS index variants. High-confidence risk genes account for a significantly enriched heritability, as estimated by stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression. Moreover, high-confidence risk genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissues, especially prenatally, and are enriched for targets of approved drugs, suggesting opportunities to reposition existing drugs for SCZ. Thus, iRIGS can leverage accumulating functional genomics and GWAS data to advance our understanding of SCZ etiology and potential therapeutics.},

abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to an increasing availability of large multi-tissue data sets which contain gene expression measurements across different tissues and individuals. In this setting, variation in expression levels arises due to contributions specific to genes, tissues, individuals, and interactions thereof. Classical clustering methods are ill-suited to explore these three-way interactions and struggle to fully extract the insights into transcrip-tome complexity contained in the data. We propose a new statistical method, called MultiCluster, based on semi-nonnegative tensor decomposition which permits the investigation of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues simultaneously. We further develop a tensor projection procedure which detects covariate-related genes with high power, demonstrating the advantage of tensor-based methods in incorporating information across similar tissues. Through simulation and application to the GTEx RNA-seq data from 53 human tissues, we show that MultiCluster identifies three-way interactions with high accuracy and robustness.},

However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host. Probiotics perturb rather than aid in microbiota recovery back to baseline after antibiotic treatment in humans.},

abstract = {Hormones control the major biological functions of stress response, growth, metabolism, and reproduction. In animals, these hormones show pronounced seasonality, with different set-points for different seasons. In humans, the seasonality of these hormones remains unclear, due to a lack of datasets large enough to discern common patterns and cover all hormones. Here, we analyze an Israeli health record on 46 million person-years, including millions of hormone blood tests. We find clear seasonal patterns: The effector hormones peak in winter−spring, whereas most of their upstream regulating pituitary hormones peak only months later, in summer. This delay of months is unexpected because known delays in the hormone circuits last hours. We explain the precise delays and amplitudes by proposing and testing a mechanism for the circannual clock: The gland masses grow with a timescale of months due to trophic effects of the hormones, generating a feedback circuit with a natural frequency of about a year that can entrain to the seasons. Thus, humans may show coordinated seasonal set-points with a winter−spring peak in the growth, stress, metabolism, and reproduction axes.},

Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Inc. Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed by healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches. Probiotics transiently colonize the human gut mucosa in highly individualized patterns, thereby differentially impacting the indigenous microbiome and host gene-expression profile, a trait which is predictable by baseline host and microbiome features, but not by stool shedding.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is a fundamental tool for pattern discovery of complex heterogeneous data. Prevalent clustering methods mainly focus on vector or matrix-variate data and are not applicable to general-order tensors, which arise frequently in modern scientific and business applications. Moreover, there is a gap between statistical guarantees and computational efficiency for existing tensor clustering solutions due to the nature of their non-convex formulations. In this work, we bridge this gap by developing a provable convex formulation of tensor co-clustering. Our convex co-clustering (CoCo) estimator enjoys stability guarantees and its computational and storage costs are polynomial in the size of the data. We further establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the CoCo estimator, which reveals a surprising "blessing of dimensionality" phenomenon that does not exist in vector or matrix-variate cluster analysis. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive simulated studies. Finally, we apply the CoCo estimator to the cluster analysis of advertisement click tensor data from a major online company. Our clustering results provide meaningful business insights to improve advertising effectiveness.},

The common practice of matricizing high-dimensional data is due to the ubiquitousness and strong theoretical foundations of matrix algebra. Various tensor-based approximations have been proposed to exploit high-dimensional correlations. While these high-dimensional techniques have been effective in many applications, none have been theoretically proven to outperform matricization generically. In this study, we propose matrix-mimetic, tensor-algebraic formulations to preserve and process data in its native, multidimensional format. For a general family of tensor algebras we prove the superiority of optimal truncated tensor representations to traditional matrix-based representations with implications for other related tensorial frameworks.

Focusing on a two-stage nonconvex estimation algorithm proposed by (Cai et al., 2019), we characterize the distribution of this estimator down to fine scales. This distributional theory in turn allows one to construct valid and short confidence intervals for both the unseen tensor entries and its underlying tensor factors. The proposed inferential procedure enjoys several important features: (1) it is fully adaptive to noise heteroscedasticity, and (2) it is data-driven and adapts automatically to unknown noise distributions. Furthermore, our findings unveil the statistical optimality of nonconvex tensor completion: it attains un-improvable estimation accuracy-including both the rates and the pre-constants-under i.i.d.

abstract = {Perceptions, thoughts, and actions unfold over millisecond timescales, while learned behaviors can require many days to mature. While recent experimental advances enable large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high temporal fidelity, it remains a formidable challenge to extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor component analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected, low-dimensional descriptions of neural data: neuron factors, reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions within each trial; and trial factors, describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning. Williams et al. describe an unsupervised method to uncover simple structure in large-scale recordings by extracting distinct cell assemblies with rapid within-trial dynamics, reflecting interpretable aspects of perceptions, actions, and thoughts, and slower across-trial dynamics reflecting learning and internal state changes.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) framework for tensor object feature extraction. Objects of interest in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications, such as 2D/3D images and video sequences are naturally described as tensors or multilinear arrays. The proposed framework performs feature extraction by determining a multilinear projection that captures most of the original tensorial input variation. The solution is iterative in nature and it proceeds by decomposing the original problem to a series of multiple projection subproblems. As part of this work, methods for subspace dimensionality determination are proposed and analyzed. It is shown that the MPCA framework discussed in this work supplants existing heterogeneous solutions such as the classical principal component analysis (PCA) and its two-dimensional (2DPCA) variant. Finally, a tensor object recognition system is proposed with the introduction of a discriminative tensor feature selection mechanism and a novel classification strategy, and applied to the problem of gait recognition. Results presented here indicate MPCA's utility as a feature extraction tool. It is shown that even without a fully optimized design, an MPCA-based gait recognition module achieves highly competitive performance and compares favorably to the state-of-the-art gait recognizers.},

abstract = {Tensor completion is a natural higher-order generalization of matrix completion where the goal is to recover a low-rank tensor from sparse observations of its entries. Existing algorithms are either heuristic without provable guarantees, based on solving large semidefinite programs which are impractical to run, or make strong assumptions such as requiring the factors to be nearly orthogonal. In this paper we introduce a new variant of alternating minimization, which in turn is inspired by understanding how the progress measures that guide convergence of alternating minimization in the matrix setting need to be adapted to the tensor setting. We show strong provable guarantees, including showing that our algorithm converges linearly to the true tensors even when the factors are highly correlated and can be implemented in nearly linear time. Moreover our algorithm is also highly practical and we show that we can complete third order tensors with a thousand dimensions from observing a tiny fraction of its entries. In contrast, and somewhat surprisingly, we show that the standard version of alternating minimization, without our new twist, can converge at a drastically slower rate in practice.},

abstract = {Research in tensor representation and analysis has been rising in popularity in direct response to a) the increased ability of data collection systems to store huge volumes of multidimensional data and b) the recognition of potential modeling accuracy that can be provided by leaving the data and/or the operator in its natural, multidimensional form. In recent work [1], the authors introduced the notion of the t-product, a generalization of matrix multiplication for tensors of order three, which can be extended to multiply tensors of arbitrary order [2]. The multiplication is based on a convolution-like operation, which can be implemented efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The corresponding linear algebraic framework from the original work was further developed in [3], and it allows one to elegantly generalize all classical algorithms from numerical linear algebra. In this paper, we extend this development so that tensor-tensor products can be defined in a so-called transform domain for any invertible linear transform. In order to properly motivate this transform-based approach, we begin by defining a new tensor-tensor product alternative to the t-product. We then show that it can be implemented efficiently using DCTs, and that subsequent definitions and factorizations can be formulated by appealing to the transform domain. Using this new product as our guide, we then generalize the transform-based approach to any invertible linear transform. We introduce the algebraic structures induced by each new multiplication in the family, which is that of C<sup>∗</sup>-algebras and modules. Finally, in the spirit of [4], we give a matrix-algebra based interpretation of the new family of tensor-tensor products, and from an applied perspective, we briefly discuss how to choose a transform. We demonstrate the convenience of our new framework within the context of an image deblurring problem and we show the potential for using one of these new tensor-tensor products and resulting tensor-SVD for hyperspectral image compression.},

abstract = {In the race to bring Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the edge, collaborative intelligence has emerged as a promising way to lighten the computation load on edge devices that run applications based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Typically, a deep model is split at a given layer into edge and cloud sub-models. The deep feature tensor produced by the edge sub-model is transmitted to the cloud, where the remaining computationally intensive workload is performed by the cloud sub-model. The communication channel between the edge and cloud is imperfect, which will result in missing data in the deep feature tensor received at the cloud side, an issue that has mostly been ignored by existing literature on the topic. In this paper we study four methods for recovering missing data in the deep feature tensor. Three of the studied methods are existing, generic tensor completion methods, and are adapted here to recover deep feature tensor data, while the fourth method is newly developed specifically for deep feature tensor completion. Simulation studies show that the new method is 3 − 18 times faster than the other three methods, which is an important consideration in collaborative intelligence. For VGG16's sparse tensors, all methods produce statistically equivalent classification results across all loss levels tested. For ResNet34's non-sparse tensors, the new method offers statistically better classification accuracy (by 0.25% − 6.30%) compared to other methods for matched execution speeds, and second-best accuracy among the four methods when they are allowed to run until convergence.},

abstract = {Simple structure and other common principles of factor rotation do not in general provide strong grounds for attributing explanatory significance to the factors which they select. In contrast, it is shown that an extension of Cattell's principle of rotation to Proportional Profiles (PP) offers a basis for determining explanatory factors for three-way or higher order multi-mode data. Conceptual models are developed for two basic patterns of multi-mode data variation, system- and object-variation, and PP analysis is found to apply in the system-variation case. Although PP was originally formulated as a principle of rotation to be used with classic two-way factor analysis, it is shown to embody a latent three-mode factor model, which is here made explicit and generalized frown two to N "parallel occasions". As originally formulated, PP rotation was restricted to orthogonal factors. The generalized PP model is demonstrated to give unique "correct" solutions with oblique, non-simple structure, and even non-linear factor structures. A series of tests, conducted with synthetic data of known factor composition, demonstrate the capabilities of linear and non-linear versions of the model, provide data on the minimal necessary conditions of uniqueness, and reveal the properties of the analysis procedures when these minimal conditions are not fulfilled. In addition, a mathematical proof is presented for the uniqueness of the solution given certain conditions on the data. Three-mode PP factor analysis is applied to a three-way set of real data consisting of the fundamental and first three formant frequencies of 11 persons saying 8 vowels. A unique solution is extracted, consisting of three factors which are highly meaningful and consistent with prior knowledge and theory concerning vowel quality. The relationships between the three-mode PP model and Tucker's multi-modal model, McDonald's non-linear model and Carroll and Chang's multi-dimensional scaling model are explored.},

In this paper, we propose a novel tensor completion model for visual multi-dimensional data completion under the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. In the proposed method, tensor is treated as a whole and a truncated nuclear norm regularization is employed to exploit the structural properties in a tensor and hidden information existing among the adjacent channels of a tensor. Besides, we introduce a weighted tensor to adjust the residual error of each frontal slices in consideration of their different recovery statistics. It does enhance the sparsity of all unfoldings of the tensor and accelerates the convergence of the proposed method.

Furthermore, three sets of simulated and two sets of real scRNA-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, are used to carry out numerical experiments and compared with other six published methods. Error accuracy and clustering results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. Moreover, we clearly identify two cell subpopulations after imputing the real scMO-seq data from hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, Gene Ontology identifies 7 genes in Bile secretion pathway, which is related to metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma.

abstract = {We consider a problem of considerable practical interest: the recovery of a data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen? We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys m ≥ C n 1.2 r log n for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n × n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information. 718 Found Comput Math (2009) 9: 717-772 Keywords Matrix completion {\textperiodcentered} Low-rank matrices {\textperiodcentered} Convex optimization {\textperiodcentered} Duality in optimization {\textperiodcentered} Nuclear norm minimization {\textperiodcentered} Random matrices {\textperiodcentered} Noncommutative Khintchine inequality {\textperiodcentered} Decoupling {\textperiodcentered} Compressed sensing Mathematics Subject Classification (2000) Primary 90C25 {\textperiodcentered} Secondary 90C59 {\textperiodcentered} 15A52},

abstract = {Factor analysis is among the most-widely used methods for dimensionality reduction in genome biology, with applications from personalized health to single-cell studies. Existing implementations of factor analysis assume independence of the observed samples, an assumption that fails in emerging spatio-temporal profiling studies. Here, we present MEFISTO, a flexible and versatile toolbox for modelling high-dimensional data when spatial or temporal dependencies between the samples are known. MEFISTO maintains the established benefits of factor analysis for multi-modal data, but enables performing spatio-temporally informed dimensionality reduction, interpolation and separation of smooth from non-smooth patterns of variation. Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate MEFISTO through applications to an evolutionary atlas of mammalian organ development, where the model reveals conserved and evolutionary diverged developmental programs. In applications to a longitudinal microbiome study in infants, birth mode and diet were highlighted as major causes for heterogeneity in the temporally-resolved microbiome over the first years of life. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can also be applied to spatially resolved transcriptomics.},

We show that a gradient descent algorithm with initial value obtained from a spectral method can, in particular, reconstruct a ${d\times d\times d}$ tensor of multilinear ranks $(r,r,r)$ with high probability from as few as $O(r^{7/2}d^{3/2}\log^{7/2}d+r^7d\log^6d)$ entries. In the case when the ranks $r=O(1)$, our sample size requirement matches those for nuclear norm minimization (Yuan and Zhang, 2016a), or alternating least squares assuming orthogonal decomposability (Jain and Oh, 2014). Unlike these earlier approaches, however, our method is efficient to compute, easy to implement, and does not impose extra structures on the tensor. Numerical results are presented to further demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Non-convex optimization with local search heuristics has been widely used in machine learning, achieving many state-of-art results. It becomes increasingly important to understand why they can work for these NP-hard problems on typical data. The landscape of many objective functions in learning has been conjectured to have the geometric property that “all local optima are (approximately) global optima”, and thus they can be solved efficiently by local search algorithms. However, establishing such property can be very difficult. In this paper, we analyze the optimization landscape of the random over-complete tensor decomposition problem, which has many applications in unsupervised learning, especially in learning latent variable models. In practice, it can be efficiently solved by gradient ascent on a non-convex objective. We show that for any small constant $\epsilon$> 0 , among the set of points with function values (1 + $\epsilon$) -factor larger than the expectation of the function, all the local maxima are approximate global maxima. Previously, the best-known result only characterizes the geometry in small neighborhoods around the true components. Our result implies that even with an initialization that is barely better than the random guess, the gradient ascent algorithm is guaranteed to solve this problem. However, achieving such a initialization with random guess would still require super-polynomial number of attempts. Our main technique uses Kac–Rice formula and random matrix theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first time when Kac–Rice formula is successfully applied to counting the number of local optima of a highly-structured random polynomial with dependent coefficients.},

abstract = {A higher-order tensor allows several possible matricizations (reshapes into matrices). The simultaneous decay of singular values of such matricizations has crucial implications on the low-rank approximability of the tensor via higher-order singular value decomposition. It is therefore an interesting question which simultaneous properties the singular values of different tensor matricizations actually can have, but it has not received the deserved attention so far. In this paper, preliminary investigations in this direction are conducted. While it is clear that the singular values in different matricizations cannot be prescribed completely independent from each other, numerical experiments suggest that sufficiently small, but otherwise arbitrary perturbations preserve feasibility. An alternating projection heuristic is proposed for constructing tensors with prescribed singular values (assuming their feasibility). Regarding the related problem of characterising sets of tensors having the same singular values in specified matricizations, it is noted that orthogonal equivalence under multilinear matrix multiplication is a sufficient condition for two tensors to have the same singular values in all principal, Tucker-type matricizations, but, in contrast to the matrix case, not necessary. An explicit example of this phenomenon is given.},

Here we report the generation and analysis of exon-level transcriptome and associated genotyping data, representing males and females of different ethnicities, from multiple brain regions and neocortical areas of developing and adult post-mortem human brains. We found that 86 per cent of the genes analysed were expressed, and that 90 per cent of these were differentially regulated at the whole-transcript or exon level across brain regions and/or time. The majority of these spatio-temporal differences were detected before birth, with subsequent increases in the similarity among regional transcriptomes. The transcriptome is organized into distinct co-expression networks, and shows sex-biased gene expression and exon usage. We also profiled trajectories of genes associated with neurobiological categories and diseases, and identified associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression.

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Consumption of dietary fibre can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity4–6. A substantial number of reports have explored the effects of dietary fibre on the gut microbial community7–9. However, the microbiome is complex, dynamic and exhibits considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in its composition and functions. The large number of potential interactions between the components of the microbiome makes it challenging to define the mechanisms by which food ingredients affect community properties. Here we address the question of how foods containing different fibre preparations can be designed to alter functions associated with specific components of the microbiome. Because a marked increase in snack consumption is associated with westernization, we formulated snack prototypes using plant fibres from different sustainable sources that targeted distinct features of the gut microbiomes of individuals with obesity when transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. We used these snacks to supplement controlled diets that were consumed by adult individuals with obesity or who were overweight. Fibre-specific changes in their microbiomes were linked to changes in their plasma proteomes indicative of an altered physiological state. Fibre snacks that target distinct features of the microbiomes of donors with obesity transplanted into gnotobiotic mice also lead to fibre-specific changes in the microbiome and physiology when used in controlled-diet human studies.},

As part of the PROTECT (Predicting Response to Standardized Colitis Therapy) Study, we evaluated the role of the gut microbiome in disease course for 405 pediatric, new-onset, treatment-naive UC patients. Patients were monitored for 1 year upon treatment initiation, and microbial taxonomic composition was analyzed from fecal samples and rectal biopsies. Depletion of core gut microbes and expansion of bacteria typical of the oral cavity were associated with baseline disease severity. Remission and refractory disease were linked to species-specific temporal changes that may be implicative of therapy efficacy, and a pronounced increase in microbiome variability was observed prior to colectomy. Finally, microbial associations with disease-associated serological markers suggest host-microbial interactions in UC. These insights will help improve existing treatments and develop therapeutic approaches guiding optimal medical care. Many patients exhibit incomplete responses to ulcerative colitis (UC) therapy. Schirmer et al. investigate the gut microbiome's role in pediatric UC treated with two conventional therapies.

abstract = {Microbial longitudinal studies are powerful experimental designs utilized to classify diseases, determine prognosis, and analyze microbial systems dynamics. In longitudinal studies, only identifying differential features between two phenotypes does not provide sufficient information to determine whether a change in the relative abundance is short-term or continuous. Furthermore, sample collection in longitudinal studies suffers from all forms of variability such as a different number of subjects per phenotypic group, a different number of samples per subject, and samples not collected at consistent time points. These inconsistencies are common in studies that collect samples from human subjects. We present MetaLonDA, an R package that is capable of identifying significant time intervals of differentially abundant microbial features. MetaLonDA is flexible such that it can perform differential abundance tests despite inconsistencies associated with sample collection. Extensive experiments on simulated datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaLonDA with significant improvement over alternative methods. We applied MetaLonDA to the DIABIMMUNE cohort (
                    https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune

Additionally, we established significant time intervals during which novel differentially relative abundant microbial genera may contribute to aberrant immunogenicity and development of autoimmune disease. MetaLonDA is computationally efficient and can be run on desktop machines. The identified differentially abundant features and their time intervals have the potential to distinguish microbial biomarkers that may be used for microbial reconstitution through bacteriotherapy, probiotics, or antibiotics. Moreover, MetaLonDA can be applied to any longitudinal count data such as metagenomic sequencing, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, or RNAseq. MetaLonDA is publicly available on CRAN (

@article{Plantinga2017,
abstract = {Community-level analysis of the human microbiota has culminated in the discovery of relationships between overall shifts in the microbiota and a wide range of diseases and conditions. However, existing work has primarily focused on analysis of relatively simple dichotomous or quantitative outcomes, for example, disease status or biomarker levels. Recently, there is also considerable interest in the relationship between the microbiota and censored survival outcomes, such as in clinical trials. How to conduct community-level analysis with censored survival outcomes is unclear, since standard dissimilarity-based tests cannot accommodate censored survival times and no alternative methods exist. We develop a new approach, MiRKAT-S, for community-level analysis of microbiome data with censored survival times. MiRKAT-S uses ecologically informative distance metrics, such as the UniFrac distances, to generate matrices of pairwise distances between individuals' taxonomic profiles. The distance matrices are transformed into kernel (similarity) matrices, which are used to compare similarity in the microbiota to similarity in survival times between individuals. Simulation studies using synthetic microbial communities demonstrate correct control of type I error and adequate power. We also apply MiRKAT-S to examine the relationship between the gut microbiota and survival after allogeneic blood or bone marrow transplant. We present MiRKAT-S, a method that facilitates community-level analysis of the association between the microbiota and survival outcomes and therefore provides a new approach to analysis of microbiome data arising from clinical trials.},
